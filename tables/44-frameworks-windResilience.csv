ASCE Prestandard for Performance-Based Wind Design,"The framework provides recommended design processes for performance-based wind design of structural systems (Main Wind Force Resisting Systems, MWFRS) and building envelopes.","1) Codify and standardize advanced engineering principles.
2) Assess structural safety over the lifecycle of the structure.",US - Global,Publication,"Advanced draft stage, yet not an official standard.","Building owners, engineers and designers, public administration.","While the primary focus is on new constructions, the principles can be applied to the renovation of existing structures to ensure they meet performance-based wind design criteria.","The framework addresses occupant comfort and safety by ensuring buildings can withstand wind events without significant loss of structural integrity, thus contributing to overall resilience and satisfaction.","Structural safety, Building envelope.","Level 1: Local
