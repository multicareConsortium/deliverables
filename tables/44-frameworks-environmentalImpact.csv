ITACA protocol - buildings,"The Itaca Protocol is a tool for assessing the level of energy and environmental sustainability of buildings.

The Protocol makes it possible to verify the performance of a building in reference to:
-  building consumption
- energy efficiency
-  impact on the environment
- impact on human health.                                                          The ITACA Protocol is derived from the SBTool international evaluation model, developed as part of the Green Building Challenge research process, and contextualized to the Italian territory in relation to the reference legislation and its environmental characteristics.

","The Itaca Protocol has different uses and purposes in relation to its different use:

1) is a design support tool for professionals.
2) is a control and guidance tool for the public administration.
3) supports  the choice of  consumer.
4) enhances an investment for financial operators.",IT,Protocol,Full Launch,"All building stakeholders accross all building lifecycle from design and construction stages to end users, including governance level.","Addresses building sustainability, energy efficiency,human health.",(see criteria),(see criteria),Building scale (residential and non residential buildings).,"Multi-criteria analysis system for assessing environmental sustainability, structured according to three hierarchical levels:

ITACA protocol- Urban Areas,"ITACA Protocol at Urban Scale is a multi-criteria assessment system for the evaluation of environmental sustainability of an urban context. Starting from a set of basic assessment items, the ITACA Protocol Urban Scale aims to provide a final performance score, indicative of the sustainability level of the urban settlement. The constituent elements of the evaluation method can be summarized as follows:
- a set of evaluation items, called criteria;
- a set of quantities, called indicators, which allow to quantify the performance of the urban area in relation to each criteria. The criteria are  distributed in a series of thematic areas that try to define the complexity of urban quality; governance; urban morphology; landscape integration; quality of the design (bld./site); public spaces; urban metabolism; biodiversity; adaptation; mobility / accessibility; social and functional diversity; economic-social effects.","The objective of this protocol, which will act in synergy with other protocols relating to building sustainability  and facilitate appropriate responses to urban regeneration, is:
1) To provide a cross-scale assessment that will measure the sustainability level of interventions in urban environments ranging in size from the block to the city. Thus, it will be useful for public planning bodies and all those stakeholders in developing or transforming urban areas in order to implement its use also in support of financing programs at national level for urban regeneration.

The protocol, although reflecting the analogous building-scale protocol, is structured on a set of significantly more open and inclusive principles that have led to evaluation criteria for environmental, economic and sustainability of the interventions. The macro themes on which the evaluation is based concern governance, including the participatory process, city planning aspects, urban landscape quality, architectural aspects, public spaces, urban metabolism, biodiversity, adaptation, mobility and accessibility, society, culture and economy.",IT,Protocol,In progress,"All buildings and urban spaces/neiborhood  stakeholders accross all building lifecycle from design and construction stages to end users, with a stron focus on  governance and public authorities.","Urban regeneration, mobility, public spaces, social inclusion, urban metabolism, access and flexilbility of spaces, human health.",(see criteria),(see criteria),Urban  scale,"The ITACA Urban Scale Protocol is structured according to three hierarchical levels: Areas, Categories and Criteria. (e.g. Area: Economy, Category: Access to residence, Criterion: Economic accessibility to residential rent)
The Areas represent macro-themes that are considered significant for the purpose of assessing the environmental sustainability of an urban context. In the ITACA Protocol at Scala Urbana there are 11 areas:
▪ Governance;
▪ Town planning aspects;
▪ Quality of the urban landscape;
▪ Architectural aspects;
▪ Public Spaces;
▪ Urban metabolism;
▪ Biodiversity;
▪ Adaptation;
▪ Mobility/Accessibility;
▪ Society and Culture;
▪ Economy.
The Categories deal with particular aspects of the areas. The Criteria represent the evaluation items of the protocol and each criterion is associated with one or more physical quantities that make it possible to quantify the
performance of the urban area in relation to the criterion considered through the attribution of a numerical value. These quantities are represented by indicators. Each area includes several categories (in variable number depending on the area considered), each of which deals with a particular aspect of the topic to which it belongs. The categories are, in turn, divided into criteria, each of which explores a particular aspect of the belonging category. Finally, the Criteria represent the evaluation items of the method and are used to characterize the performance of the building at the beginning of the evaluation process.
